# forms-flow-web Vue Events 

 > This section elaborates  events used in forms-flow-web.
 >  The Form.io renderer uses the [EventEmitter3](https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3) library to manage all of the event handling that occurs within the renderer. Within the Form.io renderer, there are a number of events that are fired that allow you to respond to these events and then do something once they fire.
