### Things to look out when integrating

- In the Vue project's `main.ts` file which you are integrating, add
the following code to use our Vuex modules:

```
import FormsFlowStore from 'camunda-formio-tasklist-vue/src/store/index'
Vue.use(FormsFlowStore, { store })
```

- Write a seperate router in integration project for defining routers for
Application History `view submission` using our component to view
the Form.
