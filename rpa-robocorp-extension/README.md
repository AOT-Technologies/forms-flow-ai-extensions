## Introduction

This is an extension provided by [formsflow.ai](https://formsflow.ai/) to enable RPA feature  to automate complex tasks.
Therefore, this application can be extended with camunda by enabling the external task handler from the service task and 
further collaborated with a Robot.

## About the Project

The project was initiated by [AOT Technologies](https://www.aot-technologies.com/)  as a means of addressing the complex
robotic use-cases which need to be automated outside [formsflow.ai](https://formsflow.ai/).

Typical use cases are:

* Browser task eg: web scraping.
* Tedious excel task eg: copying data from other sources to a given Excel file.
* PDF task eg: associating html pages / images to a PDF file.

### Features

* Builtin association with OpenSource RPA framework Robocorp.
* Configurable robot with audit and history.
* Support both cloud and command line robots.
* Input / Output operation supported.
* Supports multiple OS eg: Windows 10, Linux.
* Supports Docker build.

## Quick Start

Following instructions need to be followed to run this project.

1. Make sure to have Camunda running.
2. Create a simple process model with an External Service Task and define the topic as 'topicName'
3. Deploy the process to the Camunda Platform engine.
4. Create a robot and associate it with the topic like in BackgroundCheckRobotHandler by creating a new handler.
5. Start the camunda-rpa-client app.
6. Log in to formsflow.ai web component and associate the workflow with a form and submit the form.
7. The robot will be triggered

## Usage

For usage instructions, Please refer [here](./external-client-extension/USAGE.md)
 
## About External Client

This project is an extension to camunda's own [External task client](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/clients/java) to run robots

This works based on an external task subscription, it triggers the robots using [rcc](https://robocorp.com/docs/rcc/installation).

On completion of the robot, the external task client will send the completion request with data if any to camunda.
